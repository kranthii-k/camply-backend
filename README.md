## Auth Flow

```
Register/Login
  → Server issues:
      accessToken  (15 min, in response body)
      refreshToken (7 days, httpOnly cookie)

  → Client stores:
      accessToken  → memory / localStorage
      refreshToken → auto-sent via cookie

  → On 401 Unauthorized:
      POST /api/v1/auth/refresh → new accessToken

  → On logout:
      POST /api/v1/auth/logout → cookie cleared + DB row deleted
```

---

## WebSocket Events (Socket.IO)

### Client → Server

```js
socket.emit("join-chat", chatId)
socket.emit("leave-chat", chatId)
socket.emit("send-message", { chatId, content })
socket.emit("typing", chatId)
```

### Server → Client

```js
socket.on("new-message", message)         // message with sender info
socket.on("user-typing", { userId, username })
socket.on("error", { message })
// Notifications (personal room, sent automatically by the server)
socket.on("match", { matchedUserId })     // mutual match occurred
socket.on("new-comment", { commenterId, postId })
socket.on("new-vote", { voterId, postId, value })
socket.on("team-invite", { teamId, teamName })
```

**Authentication:** Pass access token in handshake:
```js
const socket = io("https://api.camply.live", {
  auth: { token: accessToken }
})
```

---

## Response Format

All responses follow this shape:

```json
// Success
{ "success": true, "message": "...", "data": { ... } }

// Error
{ "success": false, "error": { "message": "...", "details": [...] } }
```

# 🛠️ Dev Log — Problems Faced & How I Solved Them

A honest log of real bugs I hit while building Camply and exactly how I fixed them.

---

## 1. 🗑️ Deleted Posts Still Showing in Feed

**Problem:**
After deleting a post, it would still appear in the feed for up to 5 minutes.
The post was being deleted from the database successfully, but the frontend
kept showing it because the backend was returning a **cached version** of the feed
from Redis.

**Root Cause:**
The `deletePost` controller was missing a cache invalidation call after the DB delete.
```typescript
// ❌ Before — cache never cleared
await prisma.post.delete({ where: { id } });
sendSuccess(res, null, "Post deleted");

// ✅ After — cache cleared immediately
await prisma.post.delete({ where: { id } });
await invalidateCache(`feed:*`);
sendSuccess(res, null, "Post deleted");
```

**Lesson:**
Every write operation (create, update, delete) that affects cached data
must invalidate the relevant cache keys.

---

## 2. 👁️ Three-Dot Menu Hidden on Mobile

**Problem:**
The post options menu (⋯) was completely invisible on mobile devices.
Users couldn't delete or share their own posts on phones.

**Root Cause:**
The button had `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` applied — which works
on desktop with hover, but on mobile there is no hover state, so the
button stayed permanently invisible.

**Fix:**
```
// ❌ Before — invisible on mobile
opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100

// ✅ After — visible on mobile, hover effect on desktop
opacity-100 md:opacity-0 md:group-hover:opacity-100
```

**Lesson:**
Never hide interactive UI elements with hover-only CSS.
Always keep them visible on mobile by default.

---

## 3. 💬 Comment Count Stale After Adding Comment

**Problem:**
After a user added a comment, the comment count on the post card
stayed the same. It only updated after a full page refresh.

**Root Cause:**
The `addComment` backend controller was saving the comment to the DB
but never invalidating the Redis feed cache. So the feed still returned
the old cached post with the old `_count.comments` value.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// ✅ Added after comment is created
await invalidateCache(`feed:*`);
sendSuccess(res, { comment }, "Comment added", 201);
```

**Lesson:**
Any action that changes a count or aggregate shown in a cached feed
must bust that cache.

---

## 4. 🔄 Feed Not Refreshing After New Post Created

**Problem:**
After creating a new post, the feed wouldn't show the new post immediately.
User had to manually refresh the page to see it.

**Root Cause:**
The frontend was calling `refetch()` from the current useQuery instance.
But `refetch()` only re-runs the exact current query — if the query was
stale or the filter had changed, it silently did nothing.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// ❌ Before — unreliable
const handlePostCreated = () => {
  refetch();
};

// ✅ After — forces all feed queries to reload
const handlePostCreated = () => {
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["feed"] });
};
```

**Lesson:**
Use `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` instead of `refetch()` when you want
to guarantee fresh data across all query variants (different filters, pages etc.)

---

## 5. 📤 Share Button Copying Wrong URL

**Problem:**
The Share Post button was copying `https://beta.camply.live` (just the homepage)
instead of the actual post URL.

**Root Cause:**
The onClick handler was using `window.location.origin` which only gives
the domain, not the full path.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// ❌ Before — copies homepage
navigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.origin);

// ✅ After — copies actual post URL
const postUrl = `${window.location.origin}/posts/${id}`;
// Uses native share sheet on mobile, clipboard on desktop
if (navigator.share) {
  navigator.share({ title, text, url: postUrl });
} else {
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(postUrl);
}
```

**Lesson:**
Always test share/copy features end-to-end. `window.location.origin`
only gives you the domain — always append the specific resource path.

---

## 6. 🗳️ Votes Causing Posts to Disappear from Feed

**Problem:**
When a user voted on a post, other posts would randomly disappear
from the feed or the entire feed would re-sort/reload unexpectedly.

**Root Cause:**
Two things were happening simultaneously:
1. The backend was calling `invalidateCache("feed:*")` on every vote
2. The frontend was calling `queryClient.invalidateQueries(["feed"])` on every vote

This caused a full feed refetch on every single vote, which reset
pagination and reordered posts.

**Fix:**
Votes should **never** bust the feed cache. The vote counts are fine
to be slightly stale. Only the vote buttons on the specific post
need to update instantly via optimistic updates.

```typescript
// ❌ Removed from votePost controller
await invalidateCache(`feed:*`); // ← was causing full feed reload

// ❌ Removed from frontend handleVote
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["feed"] }); // ← was causing disappearing posts
```

**What should invalidate the feed cache:**

| Action | Bust Cache? |
|--------|------------|
| Create post | ✅ Yes |
| Delete post | ✅ Yes |
| Edit post | ✅ Yes |
| Vote on post | ❌ No |
| Add comment | ✅ Yes (count changes) |
| Delete comment | ❌ No |

**Lesson:**
Not every write action needs to bust the entire feed cache.
Over-invalidation causes worse UX than slightly stale data.

## 7. ↩️ Vote State Not Reverting on API Failure

**Problem:**
If a vote API call failed (network error, server down), the UI
would show the wrong vote state permanently. The optimistic update
applied but never rolled back.

**Root Cause:**
The `previousVote` variable was saved but never actually used
in the catch block to restore state.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Save ALL previous state before optimistic update
const prevVote = userVote;
const prevUpvotes = currentUpvotes;
const prevDownvotes = currentDownvotes;

// Apply optimistic update...

try {
  const result = await votePost(id, type);
  // Sync with real server counts
  setCurrentUpvotes(result.upvotes);
  setCurrentDownvotes(result.downvotes);
  setUserVote(result.userVote);
} catch (error) {
  // ✅ Actually rollback now
  setCurrentUpvotes(prevUpvotes);
  setCurrentDownvotes(prevDownvotes);
  setUserVote(prevVote);
}
```

**Lesson:**
Optimistic updates MUST have a proper rollback. Save the complete
previous state before mutating, not just one piece of it.

---

## 8. 🔌 Redis Cache Working But Vote Counts Wrong After Refresh

**Problem:**
Vote counts shown in the feed were correct initially but wrong
after page refresh. The cached feed had stale vote counts.

**Root Cause:**
The feed cache stored upvote/downvote counts at cache-write time.
When users voted, the DB updated but the cache was stale (5 min TTL).
The backend was also not returning real-time counts from `votePost`.

**Fix:**
Made `votePost` controller return real DB counts after every vote:
```typescript
// After any vote action, always return fresh counts
const allVotes = await prisma.vote.groupBy({
  by: ["value"],
  where: { postId },
  _count: { value: true },
});

sendSuccess(res, {
  upvotes: allVotes.find(v => v.value === 1)?._count.value || 0,
  downvotes: allVotes.find(v => v.value === -1)?._count.value || 0,
  userVote: currentVote?.value ?? null,
});
```

Frontend then syncs local state with server truth:
```typescript
const result = await votePost(id, type);
setCurrentUpvotes(result.upvotes);
setCurrentDownvotes(result.downvotes);
setUserVote(result.userVote);
```

**Lesson:**
For user-specific real-time actions like voting, always return
the server's ground truth in the response. Don't rely on the
client calculating the new state.
